# HTML & CSS Challenge One

Your challenge is to style the page, `index.html`, without editing the HTML file itself. Starting with the existing `main.css` and writing only CSS rules, can you:

- Place the website header in a left column and the page content section in a right column.
- Make the right column 3 times as wide as the left column
- Link (`<a>`) text 20% larger than the body text
- Make the space between paragraphs 1.5 times the font size
- Make the header's `<h1>` 25% larger than the body text
- Make the sections' `<h1>` 3 times the size of the body text
- Style the `<nav>` links (but not other links):
    - not have the default indentation of typical unordered lists (`<ul>`)
    - to be rectangles of dark blue text on a light blue background
    - have the colors reverse when you move the mouse over one
    - pad the links by 20px on every side
    - draw a 1px border on the bottom of each link
- Make separate styles for when the **screen is 768px wide or smaller**:
    - Make the `.wrapper` 95% width of the page, and centered
    - Make the `<header>` and `<section>` elements take up the full width of their parent container (and not float).
    - Make the header's `<h1>` 3 times the size of the body text
- Make the third paragraph (and only the third paragraph) **bold** (You can do this with a pseudo-class selector we haven't discussed)
